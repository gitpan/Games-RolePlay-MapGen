newest:

[ ] 0) go with pure d20
[ ] 1) use the inside-thresholds to determin the double-cover status
[ ] 3) that is all

old-new:

[ ] 0) See the old-new.
[ ] 1) instead of saying it's visible if _one_ of the vectors can get there
[ ]    instead, only use them for cover calc
[ ] 2) use center to center for visicalc

(must read phb/dmg to determine if this is correct, cuz the mess in ~/www/marked/ isn't.)


   Old-new LoS strategy:

[x]  1. Find all the possible closed {od} between C0 and C1 as vectors.
[x]  2. Find all 16 vectors from C0 corners to C1 corners.
[x]  3. See which of the corner vectors have a projections onto the solid {od} vectors.
[x]     a. projections is false, we need the intersection
[x]     b. see http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=253983
[x]  4. Conclusions
[x]      a. If there's at least one corner vector without a projection, there's an LoS
[x]      b. If any set of 4 C0 vectors have no projection, there's no cover


[x] Also, the LoS scores should be like so, to reflect increasing scores:

    0 LOS_NO
    1 LOS_COVER
    2 LOS_IGNORABLE_COVER
    3 LOS_YES
