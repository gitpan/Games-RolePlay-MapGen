1.2.14: Sun May 18 09:27:29 EDT 2008
   - Require the most recnet versions of XML::XPath and XML::Parser
     (Yet another freebsd patch... this might work, who knows, it already works
     fine on my freebsd virtual machine.)

1.2.13: Sat May 17 15:52:35 EDT 2008
   - Discovered various problems with different versions of XML::Parser less
     than 2.33 -- Added numeric prereq
   - Disabled the /usr/bin/xmllint test (a single test) for platforms where
     xmllint doesn't behave exactly like mine.

   - More and more documentation problems.  Meh.

1.0.2: Sun Aug 26 08:20:23 EDT 2007

1.0.1:  Sat Aug 25 18:34:04 EDT 2007
   - I fixed a drawing bug that was erasing some of the map data on an image.
   - There exists a new test in t/08 for it.  Meh. 
   - Sadly, the test showed that it was probably getting drawn correctly and the 
     sad truth is that I was drawing the empty tile (white normally) over the doors 
     that were previously drawn -- but only some of the time.  Nice.
     fixed.

0.33:  Sun Jul 15 07:39:56 EDT 2007

   - jettero fixed a few distrubution things and skelled a
     FiveSplit generator plugin

0.24:  Sat Apr  2 12:41:34 EST 2005
   - jettero am prepared to draw doors with secrets and
     locks -- including the direction they open, but he
     needs to go shopping for a tiny refigerator. The big
     one borked you see. Grrr.

0.23:  Sat Apr  2 12:30:36 EST 2005

   - jettero cleaned up the in-room-tick-marks

   - jettero drestroyed many nonsensical leading underscores
     on things that shouldn't have ever had them.

0.09:  Fri Mar 25 14:42:56 EST 2005
   - jettero just got a note from Jamis Buck -- an answer to
     a question actually. He officially approves of my
     project. Perhaps it's better to say he doesn't
     disapprove. Whatever. Thanks Jamis!

     website.

0.04:  Thu Mar 24 11:08:46 EST 2005
   - jettero created a room dropper... but he needs to quick
     adapt the perfect maze algorithm before he can use it

0.03:  Sun Mar 20 08:26:58 EST 2005
   - jettero added a huge test suite for the Tools.pm
